# Dice Rolling Game (Simulated Players)

This Python project simulates a simple dice game between two players. Each round, both players roll a six-sided die. The game runs for a number of rounds specified by the user, keeps score, and announces the overall winner at the end.

## Features

- Simulates random dice rolls using Python's `random` module
- Allows the user to choose how many rounds to play
- Prints each round's outcome and updates the score
- Declares a final winner or tie at the end

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where `dice_rolling_game.py` is located.
4. Run the program using:

## What I Learned

- How to simulate dice rolls using `random.randint()`
- Writing and calling functions to organize program logic
- Comparing values to determine a winner or tie
- Keeping track of scores with variables
- Structuring a loop to play multiple game rounds
